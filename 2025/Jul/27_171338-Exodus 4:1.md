# The Preacher's Podcast: From Doubt to Divine Power

**(Podcast Intro Music: Uplifting, inspiring, with a touch of ancient spiritual resonance)**

**(Sound of a gentle chime or harp string)**

**Preacher (Warm, confident, prophetic voice):**
Welcome, beloved friends, to "The Preacher's Podcast." I am so honored to share this sacred space with you today. There's a tangible anointing in the air, a whisper from heaven, and a Word from God that is living, active, and absolutely ready to transform your life right now. Are you ready to dive into the depths of His truth?

### 1. Short and Catchy Title of the Verse Exodus 4:1

**Preacher:**
Today, we're unlocking a powerful truth from a single verse, a verse that echoes the deepest human anxieties and points us directly to the boundless power of our Almighty God. We're calling this message: **"From Doubt to Divine Power: Your 'What Ifs' Met by God's 'I Am'!"**

### 2. Bible Text of Verse Exodus 4:1

**Preacher:**
Let's anchor ourselves in the unshakeable Word of God. Our text for today is found in the book of **Exodus, chapter 4, verse 1**. Hear the Word of the Lord:

**Exodus 4:1 (New King James Version):**
*Then Moses answered and said, “But suppose they will not believe me or listen to my voice; suppose they will say, ‘The Lord has not appeared to you.’”*

**(Pause for emphasis)**

### 3. General Context of the Verse Exodus 4:1

**Preacher:**
My dear friends, to truly grasp the profound weight of this verse, we must understand its divine backdrop. Just before this, Moses has had an encounter that would change history forever. He's standing before a bush that's burning but not consumed – a tangible manifestation of the Living God! The voice from the flame has just commissioned him with the most monumental task of his life: to confront the most powerful empire on earth, Pharaoh's Egypt, and to lead God's chosen people, Israel, out of centuries of brutal slavery.

Imagine that moment! God has just declared His very Name, "I AM WHO I AM," and pronounced His divine decree. And what is Moses’ immediate, human, relatable response? It's not a shout of "Hallelujah!" It's not a confident "Yes, Lord!" No, it’s a nervous, fear-filled, *human* question: "But suppose...?"

Moses, chosen by God, now facing the enormity of his calling, is grappling with the very real fear of rejection, of being disbelieved, of his message being dismissed. He’s looking at his own inadequacy, at the impossible odds, and he’s projecting all the reasons why God’s plan might fail *through him*. This isn't just Moses' story; it's our story. It’s the battle we all face when God calls us to something bigger than ourselves.

### 4. Introduction

**Preacher:**
Have you ever stood on the precipice of a great calling, a profound challenge, or a dream that felt too big for you, only to be ambushed by those insidious words: "But suppose...?" "But suppose I fail?" "But suppose they reject me?" "But suppose I'm not good enough?" "But suppose God hasn't *really* spoken?"

Oh, the power of a "what if"! These are the silent assassins of destiny, the whispered doubts that can paralyze even the most divinely appointed. Moses, the man destined to lead millions to freedom, faced this very internal battle. And just like Moses, you might be standing at your own "burning bush" moment right now – a moment where God is calling you higher, stretching you further, asking you to step out in faith – and that familiar, nagging voice of "suppose" tries to derail you.

But hear me now, child of God: This message today is not just about Moses’ ancient struggle. It is a prophetic word for *your* life. It’s about how God meets our human doubts, our fears, our "what ifs," not with condemnation, but with a mighty demonstration of His "I Am." It’s about receiving supernatural power to move from where you are, stuck in "suppose," to where God wants you to be, walking in "what is" – His divine reality. Get ready, because your perspective is about to shift, and your faith is about to ignite!

### 5. Opening Prayer

**Preacher:**
Let us bow our hearts and invite the King of Glory into this moment.

*Heavenly Father, You are the Alpha and the Omega, the God who sees us, knows us, and still calls us. We come before Your throne of grace right now, humble yet expectant. We thank You for Your living Word, which is sharper than any two-edged sword, discerning the thoughts and intents of our hearts. Holy Spirit, fall afresh upon us. Open our spiritual eyes to see, our ears to hear, and our hearts to receive the transforming truth You have for us today. Silence every voice of doubt, every spirit of fear, and awaken within us the boldness and confidence that comes only from You. May this Word not return void, but accomplish everything You send it to do in our lives. We commit this time to You, in the mighty name of Jesus, our Savior and Lord. Amen.*

### 6. The Power of the Word of God

**Preacher:**
Moses says, "But suppose they will not believe me or listen to my voice." And how does God respond? Does He scold Moses for his lack of faith? Does He withdraw the calling? No! The very next verses in Exodus 4 show us God's magnificent answer. God meets Moses' "suppose" with a demonstration of divine power *through* His Word.

He says, "What is that in your hand?" (Exodus 4:2). Moses says, "A rod." God says, "Cast it on the ground." And *bam!* It becomes a serpent! Then God says, "Put out your hand and take it by the tail." And *bam!* It becomes a rod again! Then God gives him a second sign, and a third!

This, my friends, is the power of the Word of God! It's not just ink on a page; it’s not just a collection of ancient stories. **The Word of God is living and active!** (Hebrews 4:12). It is infused with the very power and authority of God Himself. When God speaks, things happen! When God declares, destinies shift! When God promises, impossibilities crumble!

Moses’ doubt was met with *demonstration*. The Word of God carries the power to turn a shepherd's rod into a terrifying serpent, and back again. It carries the power to heal a leprous hand instantly, and make it whole. It carries the power to transform water into blood. And these were just *signs* to confirm the *greater power* inherent in God’s commission!

Understand this: your "what if" is merely a setup for God to show you His "what is!" When the Word of God goes forth, it carries the supernatural ability to override every logical objection, every human limitation, and every demonic resistance. Isaiah 55:11 declares, "So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it."

The power of God's Word doesn't depend on your belief in your own abilities, but on your belief in *His* ability, as revealed through His unbreakable Word! When you stand on His Word, you stand on solid rock, and the very power that parted the Red Sea, brought down Jericho, and raised Jesus from the dead is at work within you!

### 7. How to Engage with the Word of God

**Preacher:**
So, how do we, in our daily lives, engage with this living, powerful Word of God, especially when our own "supposes" threaten to overwhelm us? How do we move from passive hearing to active, transformative encounter?

1.  **Listen with Intentionality:** Moses *listened* to God’s instructions. We must train ourselves not just to read the Bible, but to *listen* for the voice of the Holy Spirit speaking *through* the text. What is God saying *to you* in this moment? What truth is He highlighting for *your* situation? It’s not about checking off a reading plan; it’s about encountering the Living God.

2.  **Believe with Conviction:** Moses had to learn to trust that God's power would accompany His Word. We must cultivate a deep conviction that God's Word is absolutely true for us, today, personally. When you read a promise, internalize it. Believe it applies to you. When you encounter a command, believe God will empower you to obey it. Doubt is a choice, but so is faith!

3.  **Apply with Obedience:** The Word of God is not meant just for intellectual assent; it's for transformative action. Moses had to *act* on what God said: cast down the rod, put his hand in his bosom. What is God asking you to do today? What step of faith is His Word calling you to take? Obedience unlocks the power of the Word in your life. Don't just be a hearer; be a doer!

4.  **Speak It Out Loud:** There is power in verbalizing God's truth. Just as God empowered Moses to speak to Pharaoh, God empowers us to speak His Word over our circumstances. When doubt whispers, *you* declare: "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!" (Philippians 4:13). When fear paralyzes, *you* proclaim: "God has not given me a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind!" (2 Timothy 1:7). Your words, empowered by His Word, carry authority!

5.  **Pray Through It:** Let the Scriptures become your prayer. When you don't know what to pray, pray the Word of God. Let it inform your communion with Him. The more His Word saturates your prayers, the more aligned your heart becomes with His will, and the more powerful your prayers become.

### 8. The Relevance of the Word of God Today

**Preacher:**
Now, some might say, "That was for Moses, thousands of years ago. What about *my* ‘supposes’ today?" Ah, my friend, the God of Moses is the God of *you*! His Word is eternal, unchanging, and eternally relevant!

Are you facing economic uncertainty and your "suppose" whispers, "But suppose I lose everything?" The Word says, "My God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus" (Philippians 4:19).

Is a health crisis gripping you, and your "suppose" cries, "But suppose I don't recover?" The Word declares, "By His stripes you were healed" (Isaiah 53:5; 1 Peter 2:24).

Are you battling insecurity, feeling inadequate, and your "suppose" shouts, "But suppose I'm not good enough?" The Word thunders, "You are fearfully and wonderfully made" (Psalm 139:14), and "I am able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you ask or think, according to the power that works in us" (Ephesians 3:20).

God *still* equips the called. Your "what if" is not a wall; it's a divine doorway. It’s an invitation for God to step in and show *His* miraculous "what is" in your life! The Holy Spirit, who empowered Moses, dwells within you, ready to release the same supernatural power through His living Word.

**Prophetic Declaration:** I declare over you right now, in the mighty name of Jesus: Every "suppose" that has held you captive is being broken! Every chain of fear, every lie of inadequacy, every whisper of doubt is being shattered by the power of God’s eternal Word! You are not walking alone. You are not unprepared. You are anointed, you are appointed, and you are equipped by the King of Kings to fulfill every single purpose He has for your life! Step out from the shadow of "what if" and into the glorious light of "what is" – God’s absolute, undeniable reality!

### 9. Conclusion

**Preacher:**
Moses began with a doubt, a human "suppose." But God met that doubt with a divine revelation of power, confirmed by His mighty Word and supernatural signs. He turned a simple shepherd's staff into a symbol of divine authority. He transformed human fear into bold obedience.

Today, my friend, God is calling you to do the same. Don't let your "what ifs" define your future. Let the "I AM" define it! Embrace the power of His Word. Engage with it daily, believe it, apply it, speak it, and pray through it. The very situations that cause you to say "but suppose" are the very opportunities for God to demonstrate His "I Am" through you! You are not defined by your doubts, but by the One who calls you, equips you, and empowers you. Step into your divine power!

### 10. Closing Prayer

**Preacher:**
Let’s close our time together by sealing this truth in our hearts.

*Almighty God, we thank You for Your incredible patience and for meeting us in our doubts. Thank You for revealing Your power and Your unfailing faithfulness through Your living Word. Lord, we lay down every "suppose" at Your feet right now. We choose to believe Your Word over our fears, Your promises over our circumstances, Your truth over every lie. Fill us afresh with Your Holy Spirit. Give us the courage to step out in faith, knowing that You are with us, equipping us, and empowering us to do all that You have called us to do. May Your Word dwell richly within us, transforming our lives from the inside out. Go before us, behind us, and within us this day. In the glorious and powerful name of Jesus, we pray. Amen and Amen!*
