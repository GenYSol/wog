# The Upward Gaze: Elevate Your Life

### (A Podcast Sermon on Colossians 3:2)

### **1. Short and Catchy Title**

The Upward Gaze: Elevate Your Life!

### **2. Bible Text of Verse Colossians 3:2**

Our anchor scripture for today's powerful word is from the Apostle Paul's letter to the Colossians, chapter 3, verse 2. Let the truth of God's Spirit resonate in your soul as we read:

> **Colossians 3:2 (NIV): "Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things."**

---

### **3. General Context of the Verse Colossians 3:2**

To truly grasp the breathtaking power of Colossians 3:2, we must understand its divine backdrop. This verse isn't a random spiritual platitude; it's a radical declaration of identity and purpose, following the groundbreaking truth found in Colossians 3:1: "If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God."

Friends, Paul is addressing believers who have experienced a profound transformation. You are no longer who you once were! You have died to the old life of sin, and you have been raised to new life *with Christ*! This isn't just a theological concept; it's a spiritual reality. Because of Christ's resurrection, *your* resurrection life has begun.

Therefore, since you are co-resurrected with the King of Kings, your focus, your drive, your very mental landscape must align with this new reality. "Set your minds" is not a suggestion; it's a divine imperative! It's a call to actively, intentionally, and consistently orient your inner world – your thoughts, desires, values, and ambitions – not on the fleeting dust of this dying world, but on the eternal, glorious realities of God's Kingdom, where Christ Himself reigns supreme. This is the foundation for an elevated life!

### **4. Introduction**

(Sound of gentle, uplifting worship music fades in and out)

**Preacher:** Greetings, beloved of God! Welcome to "The Upward Gaze," where we seek to elevate our hearts and minds to the extraordinary truth of God's Word! I am so thrilled to share this time of prophetic encounter with you.

Look around you today. What consumes the headlines? What dominates conversations? What steals your peace and drains your energy? Is it the relentless pursuit of more, the endless scroll of social media, the anxieties of financial strain, the debates of politics, or the fear of an uncertain future? The gravitational pull of this earthly realm is strong, my friends. It constantly tugs at our attention, attempting to tether us to the temporary, the trivial, and the tyrannical worries of the world.

But hear me today, a prophetic word for your soul! God has a higher call, a divine antidote to the chaos and confusion that seeks to grip your mind. He invites you, no, He commands you, through the powerful words of Colossians 3:2, to: **"Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things."** This isn't just good advice; it's the very blueprint for a life unleashed, a life of profound peace, unshakable joy, and eternal impact! This is not merely a cognitive exercise; it is a spiritual revolution that begins in the arena of your mind and transforms every fiber of your being. Get ready, because your perspective is about to be radically reset!

### **5. Opening Prayer**

**Preacher:** Let us humble ourselves before the Throne of Grace.

*Heavenly Father, Almighty God, we come before You in the mighty name of Jesus. We thank You for Your living, active, and powerful Word. Holy Spirit, we invite Your presence, Your anointing, Your illumination to flood this moment. Open the eyes of our understanding, soften the soil of our hearts, and make every listener receptive to Your divine truth. Prophesy into our spirits, renew our minds, and align our focus with Your heavenly Kingdom. We declare that every distraction, every earthly weight, every stronghold of the enemy is broken and cast down by the power of Your Spirit right now. May Your Word transform us from the inside out, for Your glory alone. We ask all this in Jesus' powerful name. Amen and Amen!*

### **6. The Power of the Word of God**

**Preacher:** Beloved, how do we "set our minds on things above"? How do we gaze upward when the world screams for our attention downward? The answer, unequivocally, is through the unadulterated, unchanging, and utterly undeniable **Power of the Word of God!**

The Word of God is not merely a book; it is the very breath of God! It is spiritual food, light for our path, a sword for our battles, and a mirror that shows us who we truly are in Christ. It is the definitive revelation of "things above."

*   **The Word reveals God's character and Kingdom:** How can you set your mind on things above if you don't know what "above" entails? The Bible paints the glorious picture of God's majesty, His eternal plan, His righteous decrees, and the unshakeable reality of His Kingdom. It reveals Christ, seated at the right hand of the Father, as the central figure of all things above!
*   **The Word renews your mind (Romans 12:2):** You cannot think heaven's thoughts with an earthly mind. The Word is the divine software update for your spirit and soul. As you immerse yourself in scripture, it progressively dismantles the old patterns of thinking – the worry, the fear, the self-pity, the limiting beliefs – and replaces them with truth, hope, faith, and eternal perspective. It literally *re-programs* your focus.
*   **The Word empowers your choices:** Setting your mind is an act of will, but it's an empowered will. When the Word saturates your being, it gives you the divine strength and discernment to *choose* what you will dwell on. It equips you to filter out the noise and consciously align your thoughts with God's. It gives you the ammunition to fight the good fight of faith in the battlefield of your mind!
*   **The Word is prophetic sustenance:** Every promise, every prophecy, every truth in scripture points to the eternal realities – the return of Christ, the new heaven and new earth, our glorious inheritance. When you meditate on the Word, you are actively participating in a prophetic act, aligning your spirit with God's ultimate future for humanity and for *you*! This isn't just about escaping earth; it's about embracing eternity now!

The Word of God is the GPS that navigates you from the temporal to the eternal. It is the fuel for your upward gaze!

### **7. How to Engage with the Word of God**

**Preacher:** So, if the Word is the vehicle to "things above," how do we effectively engage with it? This isn't about rote obligation; it's about radical transformation!

Here are practical, anointed ways to set your mind through the Word:

1.  **Consistent Intake – Read & Hear:** Make a daily appointment with the King of Glory in His Word. Whether it's reading your Bible, listening to an audio Bible, or tuning into solid, Bible-centered preaching like this podcast – immerse yourself! Don't let a day pass without feeding your spirit with the heavenly manna.
2.  **Deep Meditation – Chewing the Cud:** Don't just read the Word; meditate on it. Like a cow chews its cud, ruminate on a verse. Ask the Holy Spirit: "What does this mean for me today? How does this apply to my situation? What truth is here that I need to grasp?" This is where revelation truly unlocks and shifts your thinking. Psalm 1:2 says, *“His delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law he meditates day and night.”* This is how we set our minds!
3.  **Active Memorization – Hiding it in Your Heart:** Choose verses that speak to you – like Colossians 3:2! – and commit them to memory. When anxiety strikes, when temptation whispers, when earthly worries try to overwhelm, having the Word hidden in your heart means you have immediate access to divine truth, an instant spiritual anchor to pull your mind back to "things above." Psalm 119:11 declares, *"I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you."* And that "sin" includes the sin of wrong thinking!
4.  **Intentional Application – Living it Out:** The ultimate goal of engaging with the Word is not just knowing it, but *doing* it. James 1:22 says, *"Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says."* When you apply the Word, you are actively choosing to live by heavenly principles on earth. You are demonstrating that your mind is truly set on things above, impacting your relationships, your work, your finances, your choices – everything!
5.  **Praying the Word:** Take scripture and pray it back to God. For example, pray, "Father, by Your grace, I *will* set my mind on things above today. I declare that my thoughts will align with Yours." This turns passive reading into active, faith-filled engagement.

These are not just spiritual disciplines; they are strategic maneuvers in the warfare for your mind. They are the pathways to living out Colossians 3:2 and truly elevating your life!

### **8. The Relevance of the Word of God Today**

**Preacher:** My friends, in a world reeling from constant change, overwhelming information, and increasing secularism, the relevance of "setting our minds on things above" through the Word has never been more critical, never more urgent, never more prophetic!

*   **An Antidote to Anxiety & Fear:** Earthly things are unstable. Economies rise and fall, health declines, relationships shift, political climates change. If your mind is set on these transient things, anxiety is inevitable. But when your mind is set on "things above" – on an unchanging God, eternal promises, and an unshakeable Kingdom – peace becomes your portion. The Word anchors you in eternal truth amidst temporal chaos.
*   **A Compass in Moral Relativism:** Our society is adrift, questioning truth itself. The Word of God provides a fixed, divine moral compass. It defines right and wrong, good and evil, from God's perspective. Setting your mind on its eternal principles gives you unwavering direction in a confused world.
*   **Freedom from Consumerism and Idolatry:** The world constantly screams, "You need more! You are not enough without this!" This is the essence of setting your mind on earthly things. The Word reveals that true fulfillment, lasting joy, and ultimate value are found only in Christ and His Kingdom. It frees you from the bondage of comparison and discontent, allowing you to live abundantly with less, because your treasure is in heaven.
*   **Empowerment for Kingdom Impact:** When your mind is set on things above, your perspective shifts from selfish ambition to divine purpose. You begin to see opportunities to advance God's Kingdom on earth. Your daily tasks become sacred, your interactions become divine appointments, and your life becomes a conduit for heaven's influence. This isn't about escaping the world; it's about transforming it from an elevated perspective!
*   **A Prophetic Lens for the Future:** The Word is God's unfolding story. It speaks of the past, reveals the present, and illuminates the future. When your mind is immersed in it, you gain a prophetic understanding of world events, discerning God's hand at work, and living with a hopeful expectation of Christ's return and the full establishment of His glorious Kingdom.

In a world desperate for hope and meaning, your focused mind, empowered by the Word of God and set on things above, becomes a radiant beacon of His light and truth!

### **9. Conclusion**

(Sound of gentle, uplifting worship music fades in)

**Preacher:** So, my dear friends, we return to the profound simplicity of Colossians 3:2: **"Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things."** This is more than a suggestion; it is a divine invitation to a life of unparalleled peace, purpose, and power. It is a prophetic call to choose your focus, to guard your mind, and to actively cultivate a heavenly perspective in a very earthly world.

The choice is yours, moment by moment, thought by thought. Will you allow the fleeting distractions of this world to dictate your inner landscape, or will you intentionally, consistently, and passionately engage with the Word of God to set your mind on the eternal glories of Christ and His Kingdom?

This is not a one-time decision; it is a daily discipline, a moment-by-moment alignment. But the reward is immeasurable: a transformed mind, a renewed spirit, a life infused with divine purpose, and an unshakeable peace that transcends all earthly understanding.

Today, make a fresh commitment. Let the Word of God be your constant companion, your guide, your source of truth. Live with an upward gaze, for where your mind is set, there your heart will follow, and there your life will truly flourish. Elevate your perspective, and watch God elevate your life!

Guard our minds from earthly distractions and the enemy's lies. Fill us with Your heavenly peace and an eternal perspective that impacts every area of our lives.*

*We pray for every listener, Father, that their minds would be renewed, their focus sharpened, and their lives transformed by the power of Your Word. May they walk in the full reality of their resurrected life in Christ, living with an upward gaze that shines Your light brightly in this world.*
