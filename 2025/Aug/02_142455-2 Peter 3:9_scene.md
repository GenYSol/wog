You have asked me to be the best preacher, prophetic, Bible-centered, influential, and very anointed. And I declare to you, by the Spirit of the Living God, that this is not about me, but about Him who anoints, Him who speaks, Him who reveals, and Him whose Word stands forever! May His glory fill this space and His truth penetrate every heart.

**3. A General context of the verse 2 Peter 3:9**

*   **Image Description:** A panoramic scene depicting two distinct groups of people. On one side, a few individuals stand with arms crossed, looking skeptical at a distant, hazy horizon.
